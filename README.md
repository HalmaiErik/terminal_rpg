# terminal_rpg
This is a project done while doing "The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced" by Joseph Delgadillo and Nick Germaine It can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/ .

 In the current build, this is a very basic RPG that can be played in the terminal. For future development I would like to make a graphical interface for it, aswell as giving it more depth.
